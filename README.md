I am a mathematician 🧮 turned data scientist 🧑‍🔬 and board game enthusiast 🎲 from Germany 🇩🇪 living in Finland 🇫🇮.

In an attempt to marry my passion for games and data science, I created the recommendation engine [Recommend.Games](https://recommend.games/#/) and write about those topics on my [blog](https://blog.recommend.games/).

Your [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/MarkusShepherd) 💸 contributes to the costs of running those services (hosting, domains, etc) and allow me to implement new features.
